# protoplanetarydiskwork
# This is some work I did for an astronomy project that studied the affect of grain size on temperature in the protoplanetary disk IM Lup
# Some of this code I wrote from scratch while others were edited from existing files on radmc3d in order to match the parameters of my
# research. I included a couple of graphs that show the results of running various pieces of code.
